    "To tackle this question, one can utilize random simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption:** Probability that no one gets their own hat tends to $e^-1$.\n",

    "**Theory:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I will be using Python. I will be using functions since it will be easier to use functions systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before I proceed, I will import the `random` module to aid with the selection from the digital urn. For cases with replacement, I will use `random.choice()`, which chooses random elements from an iterable data type, while for cases without replacement, I will use `random.sample()`, which samples out a certain number of random elements, thus not replacing any of the elements after choosing them."

    "The probability is approximately $0.368$ in each run of the experiment, and gets closer to the value of $e^{-1}$ with an increase in the sample size, thus verifying the theoretical assumption that the probability approaches $e^{-1}$, and thus the existence of a limit. This experiment also proves that a larger sample size tends to give more accurate results. Hence, the simulations verify the result. (q.e.d.) $\\blacksquare$\n",
